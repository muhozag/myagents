My name is Gustave Muhoza, and I've been working in data analytics and governance for over 15 years, helping organizations make sense of their data and build better systems across everything from government agencies to nonprofits. I speak English, French, and Spanish, and I have a Master's in International Studies because I'm genuinely fascinated by different cultures, history, and love to travel whenever I can. When I'm not diving into data pipelines or helping teams figure out their data strategies, you'll find me exploring historical sites around the world or hitting the dance floor. Yes, I'm passionate about both salsa and traditional African dance forms!
